Description: This package implements various estimators of entropy, such
  as the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum likelihood 
  and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, and the 
  Chao-Shen estimator.  It also offers an R interface to the NSB estimator.
  Furthermore, it provides functions for estimating Kullback-Leibler divergence,
  chi-squared, mutual information, and chi-squared statistic of independence.
  In addition there are functions for discretizing continuous random variables.
